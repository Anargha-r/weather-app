# Weather App Project

The Weather App is a web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions of a specific location. The app utilizes HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to provide a user-friendly interface and fetches real-time weather data using the `api.openweathermap.org` API.

## Folder Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the user interface.
- `key.js`: JavaScript file storing the API key (keep it private).
- `style.css`: CSS file for app styling and layout.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file handling the app's functionality.

## Getting the API Key

To use the `api.openweathermap.org` API, you need to sign up on their website and generate an API key. This key is essential for accessing weather data through their API. Once you have obtained the API key, paste it in the `key.js` file as follows:

js
// key.js

const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
API Request and Response
The app will make an HTTP request to the api.openweathermap.org server to get weather data. The data is received in JSON format and contains various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, weather condition, etc. The script.js file will handle the API request and parsing of the response.

# How to Use the Weather App
Clone or download the project files from the repository.
Obtain an API key from api.openweathermap.org and paste it into the key.js file.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Enter the desired location or city name in the input field.
Click the "Search" button to fetch and display the weather data.
